Transfer is a filter primitive which allows the independent manipulation of each color channel (including the alpha channel) in the input graphic. It is always a child element of a filter element and is the parent of child elements (feFuncR, feFuncG, feFuncB and feFuncA) that perform each color channel manipulation.
